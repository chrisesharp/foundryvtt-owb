            This is an unofficial, third-party implementation of the excellent <strong>WWII:Operation Whitebox™</strong> rules by <strong>Small Niche Games™</strong> and is copyright of Peter J. Spahn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pete has been tremendously supportive of this effort, and I would like to acknowledge my grateful thanks to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to get the <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/196284/OWB001-WWII-Operation-WhiteBox">WWII:Operation Whitebox™ rules</a></em> 
            in order to play. I strongly encourage you to order a copy, or get the Pay-What-You-Want
             <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/251318/OWB001-WWII-Operation-WhiteBox-FREE">PDF version.</a>

          <p>
            Combined with the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/owb-content">OGL content pack for WWII:OWB</a>, it has enough content for you to create exciting WW2 scenarios. 
            I would recommend you purchase some of the 
            <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/3356/Small-Niche-Games/subcategory/5676_26684/WWII-Operation-WhiteBox">excellent scenario packs</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            This system implementation was originally derived from the excellent <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose">Old School Essentials</a>
            system by <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques">U~man</a>. As such, it shares many of its settings and features with that system. If you are familiar
            with it (and I would highly recommend it!), you should be very comfortable using this.

          </p>
          <p>The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime
            requisites bonus that can be set in the Tweaks dialog (see above). 
            It is used when experience is dealt automatically via the party sheet.
          </p>
          <p> The <strong>Rank</strong> field will flash as soon when the character 
            has enough experience to be promoted up a rank. 
            This experience threshold is also set in the <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks dialog</a>.

          <hr>
          <h4 class="docs-header" id="attributes">Attributes</h4>
          <p>The default tab covers the basic attributes of the character.</p>

            <img src="./images/attributes.png" />
          </p>
          <p>The six base attributes are in a column on the left.</p>
          <p>Rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name, after
            clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers.</p>
          <p>The book icon above the attributes will show the modifiers for
            each attribute.</p>
          <p>
            In the 'bucket' shape next to the attributes, you will see
            the character <em>hit points</em> - current (top) and max (lower) values. 
            The 'bucket' will empty as you lose hit points.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 'target' to the right is  <em>armor class</em>.
            The top value is the AC and the lower value is the 'unarmored' armor class. 
            It's calculated depending on the <em>clothing</em> you have equipped. 
            You can add an armor bonus in the Tweaks dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third box on the right is the <em>Base Hit Bonus</em> automatically
            calculated by the character <em>rank</em> (level).
          </p>
          <p>On the second row there is a Hit Dice field you can roll to generate hit points.</p>
          <p>The third row details the Attack statistics. It will change if
            you have the Ascending AC setting enabled. On the left the Melee attack
            modifier that is influenced by strength and on the right the
            Missile modifier influenced by Dexterity.
            Both field names are clickable and will roll attacks but usually you
            would attack using the appropriate weapon in your inventory (see below).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/attack-roll.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The last row shows the three movement stats, they are calculated 
            depending on the weight you are carrying and the encumbrance options 
            (See the <a href="#inventory">inventory</a> section).
            You can disable this behavior through the <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a>
            dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally there is the <em>Universal Saving Throw</em> value.
            This can be rolled when clicked.

          </p>
          <p>
            The first row contains a rollable entry for finding <em>Hidden Things</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a
            description. These are typically class abilities.
            You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by
            dragging one from the item sidebar or a compendium.
            You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat
            with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="six columns">
              <p>
              When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you
              see you can set the ability requirements, for example 
              <code>Grunt, 3</code> to indicate a 3rd level Grunt ability, 
              or <code>Maquis</code> to indicate a standard Maquis ability.
              You can enter a roll associated with the ability.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example if Roll is <code>1d100</code>, roll type is 
              <code>&lt;=</code> and target is <code>40</code>. 
              The roll will display success in green as soon as the result
              is above 40.
              When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image
              on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.
              You can apply the roll result as damage or healing by right
              clicking on the chat card, this is true for all rolls.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="six columns">
              If you need someone else to roll the ability you can show the
              whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from
              there.
              Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking
              on its name from the character sheet.

            ammunition, clothing and other miscellaneous gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weapons are the first section. Clicking on the weapon
            icon will roll an attack with damage.

            If it is a missile weapon, a dialog will pop up to ask
            you what range you are firing at, and (if possible) whether
            you are choosing burst or suppressive fire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Damage rolled during the attack can be applied to one or several
            selected tokens if you click on the blood drop icon right to the
            result. You can apply damage or healing by right clicking on the
            chat card, this is true for all rolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking on the item name will expand the item description along with
            relevant tags.

            Here the item is a <em>.303 calibre</em> rifle, that is capable of 
            <em>burst</em> damage, has a short range of <em>150'</em>, and 
            does <em>1d6+1</em> hitpoints of damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Click on the <em>T-shirt</em> icon to indicate that your character
            is equipped/carrying that item.
            Tags that are recognized will be displayed as icons (<code>Burst</code>
            and <code>Suppress</code>)
            Other tags will be written as text.

          <p>
            Ammunition is shown in the miscellaneous gear section. Clicking on the entry
            will expand it and show its calibre and description.
            There is also a set of usage boxes to indicate the number of rounds left.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the bottom is the encumbrance bar. This is automatically calculated. 
            If you're encumbrance max value is 250 as default,
            each cursor passed is the threshold you will lose movement.

          The tweaks menu for enemies is basically the same as for

          The <em>Nationality</em> is also rollable below, and rolls a plain 2d6 on the

          This is a combination of the Abilities and Inventory tabs for characters.
          For Vehicles it is <em>Modifications &amp; Equipment</em>, but they are
          basically the same thing.
        </p>
        <h4 class="docs-header">Notes</h4>

          When you open the weapon sheet by clicking on the pen icon in the inventory, 
          or by creating a new weapon, you can edit the stats and add new tags.

        <p>
          For missile weapons that use ammunition, you must set a tag to indicate
          the calibre. This is done by adding the tag in the form of <em>size(cal)</em> 
            e.g.
            <code>9mm(cal)</code>

                <td>If you don't provide a Calibre tag, then the missile weapon does 
                  not use ammunition i.e. a throwing knife. If you do, you should 
                  only provide ONE and this will mean the weapon can only be fired 
                  if the correct ammo for the weapon is also in a positive quantity 
                  in the actors inventory.</td>

              By default each character or NPC is assigned to a group based on
              their Token disposition.
              If their disposition is hostile in the Token configuration they will
              be in group 'Red', Neutral is 'Yellow', Friendly is 'Green'. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              However, GM can change the group an actor belongs to by clicking on 
              the flag to allow for more than two factions.
            </p>
            <p>  
              I suggest you set <em>Characters</em> default Token disposition to 
              <code>Friendly</code>, <em>Enemies</em> to <code>Hostile</code>, and
              other NPCs, such as civilians, to <code>Neutral</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are happy about the groups, you can begin the combat by
              clicking below the combat tracker. You can reroll the initiative
              manually with the dice above the tracker.
            </p>
            <p> 
              If you reassign a character to a different faction you can 
              set their initiative to the group value by right clicking and 
              select 'reroll'.

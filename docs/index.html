            This is an unofficial, third-party implementation of the excellent WWII:Operation Whitebox™ rules by Small Niche Games™ and is copyright of Peter J. Spahn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pete has been tremendously supportive of this effort, and I would like to acknowledge my grateful thanks to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to get the <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/196284/OWB001-WWII-Operation-WhiteBox">WWII:Operation Whitebox™ rules</a></em> 
            in order to play. I strongly encourage you to order a copy, or get the Pay-What-You-Want
             <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/251318/OWB001-WWII-Operation-WhiteBox-FREE">PDF version.</a> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with the OGL content pack for WWII:OWB, it has enough content for you to create exciting WW2 scenarios. 
            I would recommend you purchase some of the 
            <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/3356/Small-Niche-Games/subcategory/5676_26684/WWII-Operation-WhiteBox">excellent scenario packs</a>

            This system implementation was originally derived from the excellent <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose">Old School Essentials</a>
            system by <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques">U~man</a>. As such, it shares many of its settings and features with that system. If you are familiar
            with it (and I would highly recommend it!), you should be very comfortable using this.

        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <p>The System settings are to control system-wide behaviours, and you

        </p>
        <p>
          There is only  one setting available right now to customize your experience with WWII:OWB.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ascending Armor Class</strong>: The WWII:OWB
              default option is to use the original descending Armor Class and
              the 'To Hit AC 0' attack statistic alias THAC0.
              If this input is checked, the system will use Ascending Armor Class instead.

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Recruit</strong>: Adds the Loyalty rating
                  attribute, replaces the Title field in the header by a Wage
                  input.</li>
                <li><strong>Initiative Bonus</strong>: Will add this value to
                  initiative in addition to the Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Next Level</strong>: The threshold at which the
                  level field in the Header section of the character sheet will

                <li><strong>Bonus experience</strong>: This will add to the
                  experience dealt from the Party Sheet, set manually based
                  on any bonus your character might acquire from their class.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Experience share:</strong>: The share of the party
                  XP you will get from the experience dealt.</li>

                  only for melee weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Missile Bonus</strong>: A bonus to the Attack roll
                  only for missile weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Armor Class</strong>: This value will be added
                  (ascending) or subtracted (default) to the Armor class value
                  that initially depends on the armor you wear and your
                  Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong> (GM Only): The maximum value at
                  which you can't move anymore. If you have an encumbrance of
                  1800 it will delay any movement penalty by 200 (1800-1600).</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate movement</strong> (GM Only): if you have a
                  tricky case where movement should be manually set, you can
                  uncheck this.</li>

              <img src="./images/header.png" />
            </p>
            <p>The top of the character sheet header contains text fields 
              you can edit directly. Currently there is no automation of
              the content here.
            </p>
            <p>The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime
              requisites bonus that can be set in the Tweaks dialog (see above). 
              It is used when experience is dealt automatically via the party sheet.</p>
            <p> The Level field will flash as soon when the character has enough
              experience to be promoted up a rank. This experience threshold is 
              also set in the Tweaks dialog.
            </p>
            <h6 class="docs-header">Attributes</h6>
            <p>The default tab covers the basic attributes of the character.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/attributes.png" />
            </p>
            <p>The six base attributes are in a column on the left.</p>
            <p>Rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name, after
              clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers.</p>
            <p>The book icon above the attributes will show the modifiers for
              each attribute.</p>
            <p>
              In the 'bucket' shape next to the attributes, you will see
              the character <em>hit points</em> - current (top) and max (lower) values. 
              The 'bucket' will empty as you lose hit points.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 'target' to the right is  <em>armor class</em>.
              The top value is the AC and the lower value is the 'unarmored' armor class. 
              It's calculated depending on the <em>clothing</em> you have equipped. 
              You can add an armor bonus in the Tweaks dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third box on the right is the <em>Base Hit Bonus</em> automatically
              calculated by the character <em>rank</em> (level).
            </p>
            <p>On the second row there is a Hit Dice field you can roll.</p>
            <p>The third row details the Attack statistics. It will change if
              you have the Ascending AC setting enabled. On the left the Melee attack
              modifier that is influenced by strength and on the right the
              Missile modifier influenced by Dexterity.
              Both field names are clickable and will roll attacks but usually you
              would attack using the appropriate weapon in your inventory (see below).
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/attack-roll.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The last row shows the three movement stats, they are calculated 
              depending on the weight you are carrying and the encumbrance options 
              (See the <a href="#inventory">inventory</a> section).
              You can disable this behavior through the <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a>
              dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally there is the <em>Universal Saving Throw</em> value.
              This can be rolled when clicked.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/save-roll.png" />
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/abilities.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The first row contains a rollable entry for finding <em>Hidden Things</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a
              description. These are typically class abilities.
              You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by
              dragging one from the item sidebar or a compendium.
              You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat
              with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you
              see you can set the ability requirements, for example 
              <code>Grunt, 3</code> to indicate a 3rd level Grunt ability, 
              or <code>Maquis</code> to indicate a standard Maquis ability.
              You can enter a roll associated with the ability.

              For example if Roll is <code>1d100</code>, roll type is 
              <code>&lt;=</code> and target is <code>40</code>. 
              The roll will display success in green as soon as the result
              is above 40.
              When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image
              on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.
              You can apply the roll result as damage or healing by right
              clicking on the chat card, this is true for all rolls.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability-chat.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need someone else to roll the ability you can show the
              whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from
              there.
              Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking
              on its name from the character sheet.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Inventory</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/inventory.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The inventory compiles every item you own, including weapons,
              ammunition, clothing and other miscellaneous gear. 
              Weapons are the first section. Clicking on the weapon
              icon will roll an attack with damage.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/shooting.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If it is a missile weapon, a dialog will pop up to ask
              you what range you are firing at, and (if possible) whether
              you are choosing burst or suppressive fire.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/item-attack.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Damage rolled during the attack can be applied to one or several
              selected tokens if you click on the blood drop icon right to the
              result. You can apply damage or healing by right clicking on the
              chat card, this is true for all rolls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the name will expand the item description along with
              relevant tags.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/item-expanded.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Here the item is a <em>.303 calibre</em> rifle, that is capable of 
              <em>burst</em> damage, has a short range of <em>150'</em>, and 
              does <em>1d6+1</em> hitpoints of damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Click on the <em>T-shirt</em> icon to indicate that your character
              is equipped/carrying that item.
              Tags that are recognized will be displayed as icons (<code>Burst</code>
              and <code>Suppress</code>)
              Other tags will be written as text.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you open the weapon sheet by clicking on the pen icon, you
              can edit the stats and add new tags.
              Melee, and Missile tags will check automatically the
              matching checkbox.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/weapon.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Weapons can have attack bonuses. You can add new weapon tags if
              you type text in the field below the weapon icon and press ENTER.
              You can enter multiple tags, separated by commas.
            </p>
            <p>
              For missile weapons that use ammunition, you must set a tag to indicate
              the calibre. This is done by adding the tag in the form of <em>size(cal)</em>.
                e.g.
                <code>9mm(cal)</code>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ammunition.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Ammunition is shown in the miscellaneous gear section. Clicking on the entry
              will expand it and show its calibre and description.
              There is also a set of usage boxes to indicate the number of rounds left.

              At the bottom is the encumbrance bar. This is automatically calculated. 
              If you're encumbrance max value is 250 as default,
              each cursor passed is the threshold you will lose movement.

            <p>This tab is a free space you can record description and notes.
              This is enriched so you can use inline rolls, entity links and
              other fun things.</p>
            <p>You can add known languages by clicking on the plus next to the
              language header. The number of language you can speak can be found
              in the modifier dialog in the attribute tab.</p>

            <h4>Enemies &amp; Vehicles</h4>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Tweaks</h4>
            <p>
              The tweaks menu for enemies is basically the same as for
              characters, but without experience bonus support or retainers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The tweaks menu for vehicles is only an initiative bonus. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/enemies.png" />
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Header</h4>
            <p>The first row below the name are the Hit Points, Hit Dice,
              Armour Class, Basic Hit Bonus, Movement and Saving Throw.
              and, where applicable, are rollable fields. 
              The Nationality is also rollable below, and rolls a plain 2d6 on the
              reaction table. The morale is rollable as well.</p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities &amp; Equipment</h4>
            <p>
              This is a combination of the Abilities and Inventory tabs for characters.
              For Vehicles it is <em>Modifications &amp; Equipment</em>, but they are
              basically the same thing.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Notes</h4>
            <p>
              This is an area with the same purpose and function as for characters.
            </p>

          <div id="initiative" class="docs-section">
            <h4>Initiative</h4>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Grouped initiative</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/initiative-group.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              By default each character or NPC is assigned to a group. If
              their disposition is hostile in the Token configuration they will
              be in group 'Red', Neutral is 'Yellow', Friendly is 'Green'. 
              But the GM can change the group you belong by clicking on the flag
              to allow for more than two factions.
              I suggest you set characters default Token disposition to Friendly
              and Enemies to Hostile.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are happy about the groups, you can begin the combat by
              clicking below the combat tracker. You can reroll the initiative
              manually with the dice above the tracker. 
              If you reassign a character to a different faction you can 
              set their initiative to the group value by right clicking and 
              select 'reroll'.

            This is an unofficial, third-party implementation of the excellent WWII:Operation Whitebox™ rules by Small Niche Games™
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to get the <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/251318/OWB001-WWII-Operation-WhiteBox-FREE">WWII:Operation Whitebox™ rules</a></em> 
            in order to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with the OGL content pack for WWII:OWB, it has enough content for you to create exciting WW2 scenarios. 
            I would recommend you purchase some of the 
            <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/3356/Small-Niche-Games/subcategory/5676_26684/WWII-Operation-WhiteBox">excellent scenario packs</a>
            from Small Niche Games&trade;</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            This system implementation was originally derived from the excellent <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose">Old School Essentials</a>
            system by <a href="https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques">U~man</a>. As such, it shares many of its settings and features with that system. If you are familiar
            with it (and I would highly recommend it!), you should be very comfortable using this.
          </p>

        <p>
          There is only  one setting available right now to customize your experience with WWII:OWB.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ascending Armor Class</strong>: The WWII:OWB
              default option is to use the original descending Armor Class and
              the 'To Hit AC 0' attack statistic alias THAC0.
              If this input is checked, the system will use Ascending Armor Class instead.

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Recruit</strong>: Adds the Loyalty rating
                  attribute, replaces the Title field in the header by a Wage
                  input.</li>
                <li><strong>Initiative Bonus</strong>: Will add this value to
                  initiative in addition to the Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Next Level</strong>: The threshold at which the

                <li><strong>Bonus experience</strong>: This will add to the
                  experience dealt from the Party Sheet, set manually based
                  on any bonus your character might acquire from their class.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Experience share:</strong>: The share of the party
                  XP you will get from the experience dealt.</li>
                <li><strong>Melee Bonus</strong>: A bonus to the Attack roll
                  only for melee weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Missile Bonus</strong>: A bonus to the Attack roll
                  only for missile weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Armor Class</strong>: This value will be added
                  (ascending) or subtracted (default) to the Armor class value
                  that initially depends on the armor you wear and your
                  Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong> (GM Only): The maximum value at
                  which you can't move anymore. If you have an encumbrance of
                  1800 it will delay any movement penalty by 200 (1800-1600).</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate movement</strong> (GM Only): if you have a
                  tricky case where movement should be manually set, you can
                  uncheck this.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h6 class="docs-header">Header</h6>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/header.png" />
            </p>
            <p>The top of the character sheet header contains text fields 
              you can edit directly. Currently there is no automation of
              the content here.
            </p>
            <p>The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime
              requisites bonus that can be set in the Tweaks dialog (see above). 
              It is used when experience is dealt automatically via the party sheet.</p>
            <p> The Level field will flash as soon when the character has enough
              experience to be promoted up a rank. This experience threshold is 
              also set in the Tweaks dialog.
            </p>
            <h6 class="docs-header">Attributes</h6>
            <p>The default tab covers the basic attributes of the character.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/attributes.png" />
            </p>
            <p>The six base attributes are in a column on the left.</p>
            <p>Rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name, after
              clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers.</p>
            <p>The book icon above the attributes will show the modifiers for
              each attribute.</p>
            <p>
              In the 'bucket' shape next to the attributes, you will see
              the character <em>hit points</em> - current (top) and max (lower) values. 
              The 'bucket' will empty as you lose hit points.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 'target' to the right is  <em>armor class</em>.
              The top value is the AC and the lower value is the 'unarmored' armor class. 
              It's calculated depending on the <em>clothing</em> you have equipped. 
              You can add an armor bonus in the Tweaks dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third box on the right is the <em>Base Hit Bonus</em> automatically
              calculated by the character <em>rank</em> (level).
            </p>
            <p>On the second row there is a Hit Dice field you can roll.</p>
            <p>The third row details the Attack statistics. It will change if
              you have the Ascending AC setting enabled. On the left the Melee attack
              modifier that is influenced by strength and on the right the
              Missile modifier influenced by Dexterity.
              Both field names are clickable and will roll attacks but usually you
              would attack using the appropriate weapon in your inventory (see below).
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/attack-roll.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The last row shows the three movement stats, they are calculated 
              depending on the weight you are carrying and the encumbrance options 
              (See the <a href="#inventory">inventory</a> section).
              You can disable this behavior through the <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a>
              dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally there is the <em>Universal Saving Throw</em> value.
              This can be rolled when clicked.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/save-roll.png" />
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/abilities.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The first row contains rollable entries for exploration rolls.
              Those can be speed rolled as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a
              description. It can be thieves skills, class abilities, and so on.
              You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by
              dragging one from the item sidebar or a compendium.
              You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat
              with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you
              see you can set the ability requirements, for example `Thief, 1`,
              you can enter a roll associated with the ability.
              For example if Roll is `1d100`, roll type is `>=` and target is
              `40`. The roll will display success in green as soon as the result
              is above 40.
              When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image
              on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.
              You can apply the roll result as damage or healing by right
              clicking on the chat card, this is true for all rolls.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability-chat.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need someone else to roll the ability you can show the
              whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from
              there.
              Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking
              on its name from the character sheet.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Spells</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/spells.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              You won't have this tab displayed by default. You must enable the
              `spellcaster` checkbox in the Tweaks dialog located in the sheet
              toolbar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here you can record your spellbook content. First you can add a
              new spell by clicking the plus. For each level of spell you have
              you will have a new section for its level with it's related spell
              slot counter.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning I recommend creating one New Spell for each spell
              level you have and then change their level by opening them, it
              will unblock the spell slot counters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell slots counters have two values. The first one is the number
              of spells you have memorized, it can't be edited. And the second
              one is the total number of spell slots you have. You should edit
              those as you gain new levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spells themselves have counters. The first is the remaining
              available spells, the second is the number of this spell you
              memorized.
              The spell counter decreases as you roll them by clicking their
              image. Spell slots that have been used can all be refilled by
              clicking the reset icon in the spells tab header.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/spell.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Spells are similar with abilities but have a few more infos. Rolls
              can't be configured as much, you can only set a roll string that
              respects Foundry VTT syntax.
              However you can specify a Save so when the Spell is displayed on
              chat with the eye icon, a button that triggers a save roll from
              the selected actors is displayed below the spell description.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/spell-card.png" />
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Inventory</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/inventory.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The inventory compiles every item you own from the weapon to the
              treasure. Weapons are in the first section. Clicking on the weapon
              icon will roll an attack with damage.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/item-attack.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Damage rolled during the attack can be applied to one or several
              selected tokens if you click on the blood drop icon right to the
              result. You can apply damage or healing by right clicking on the
              chat card, this is true for all rolls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking on the name will expand the item description along with
              relevant tags. Here it's the damage.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/item-collapse.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible to equip an item. The only mechanical value it has
              for now is the influence of the Slow weapon tag on initiative.
              Tags that are recognized will be displayed as icons. If you don't
              have Foundry VTT set has english and you use a translation
              (French, Spanish), you will have to use the tags translation to
              have it matched.
              Other tags will be written as text.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you open the weapon sheet by clicking on the pen icon, you
              can edit the stats and add new tags.
              Slow, Melee, and Missile tags will check automatically the
              matching checkbox. But won't uncheck it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weapons can have attack bonuses. You can add new weapon tags if
              you type text in the field below the weapon icon and press ENTER.
              You can copy the whole qualities field from the book as the tag
              parser will split the commas, and set the text between brackets as
              a hover text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other items won't be clickable. Armors have configurable Armor
              Class and an Armor type, Misc items can have a quantity directly
              editable from the inventory list. If checked as Treasure, it is
              counter in the total treasure displayed in the treasure header.

              Below is the encumbrance bar. This is used for the auto mouvement
              calculation. If you're encumbrance max value is 1600 as default,
              each cursor passed are the threshold you will lose movement.

            <p>This tab is a free space you can record description and notes.
              This is enriched so you can use inline rolls, entity links and
              other fun things.</p>
            <p>You can add known language by clicking on the plus next to the
              language header. The number of language you can speak can be found
              in the modifier dialog in the attribute tab.</p>
            <p>The language list was made compatible with the Polyglot module
              from Kakaroto, you can find it <a
                href="https://github.com/kakaroto/fvtt-module-polyglot">here</a>

            <h4>Monsters</h4>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Tweaks</h4>

              <img src="./images/monster-tweaks.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The tweaks menu for monsters is lighter. You can enable spells,
              add a value to initiative, set as retainer and that's pretty much
              it.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Header</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/monster-header.png" />
            </p>
            <p>There is a lot happening here. The first row below the name are
              all rollable fields. The alignment rolls a plain 2d6 on the
              reaction table. The two number appearing can be rolled and the
              morale as well. The XP award is just plain text though.</p>
            <p>The Treasure type is a link to a rollable table. When you drop a
              rollable table on a monster sheet it will show up here so you can
              access the treasure table quickly and roll that loot.</p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/monster-abilities.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The Hit Points can be silently rolled as you click on the dice
              next to the header. That is why Hit dice must be a rollable
              string. AC is manually typed and there is no calculation involved.
              Clicking on THAC0 will launch a raw Attack with 1d6 damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The abilities and equipment panel will contain all the heart and
              soul of your monster. You can set clickable abilities like for
              characters. There is also a weapon counter so you know how many
              attacks you made each round with your monster. The counters are
              reset with the icon in the header.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the left of the weapon icons, in the list, you can mark the
              item with a color so you can distinguish attack patterns. In the
              example here I have in red 2xClaws and Bite so here is my attack
              pattern. If I choose green I have a tail spike attack.
            </p>
            <p>You can record movement details for non-walking movement options
              your monster may have. Below are your monster's save that you can
              roll and speedroll with CTRL maintained.</p>
            <p>
              Monsters use the same content as characters for spells, weapons
              and items. The Note tab is only a large text editor where you can
              input the monster description or any other particularities that
              does not fit on the sheet itself.

            <p>
              By default each character or creature is assigned to a group. If
              their disposition is hostile in the Token configuration they will
              be in group 'Red', Neutral is yellow, Friendly is green. But the
              GM can change the group you belong by clicking on the flag, there
              is a limited number of colors but it should be enough I hope.

            <p>
              When you are happy about the groups, you can begin the combat by
              clicking below the combat tracker. You can reroll the initiative
              manually with the dice above the tracker. But if you go to the
              next round it will be rolled again. Characters equipped with a
              Slow weapon have a Weight displayed in place of the initiative
              value. If they unequip the weapon they can reset their initiative
              to the group value by right clicking and select 'reroll'.

            <p>For this part I invite you to read Foundry VTT documentation, you
              will find exactly the same behavior and features here, except that

            </p>
            <p>
              You can find Foundry VTT rollable tables in the sidebar. The
              default rollable tables can't handle treasure like specified in
              the Old School Essentials books so I had to augment them.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/treasure-toggle.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              You can toggle between the default rollable tables and the
              treasure table with the Chest icon right next to the table name.
              The default tables are selecting an entry by rolling a dice and
              returning the matching result. Treasure tables however, have a
              different behavior. Each entry is rolled with 1d100 and the value
              is compared to the 'chance field'. So it can return multiple
              items.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can select the table type you need by clicking on the chest at
              the right of the rollable table name. Once you do the fields will
              change.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">

            </p>
            <p>
              Foundry VTT allows rollable tables to be filled with enriched
              Text, Entities like journals and items and compendium objects.
              Here I use inline rolls from enriched text to tell how many coins
              I get.
            </p>
            <p>If you have only one item to be rolled you can change the result

              When in the Actors sidebar, you will find a new icon next to the

            </p>
            <p>
              The party overview app will condense a lot of stats about your
              group. At first it will be empty so you will have to click on the
              group icon on top right to select which character/monster is part
              of the party.
              Sometimes after selecting party members you may have to resync the
              display by clicking the resync icon on top left of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost every info shown on this party sheet is hoverable to have
              the exact name of what you are seeing. If you hover on the actor
              image you will se a button that allows you to open the actor
              sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The open hand icon in the window header allows you to deal
              experience to the characters in the party. This will take into
              account the experience Share set in the Characters <a
                href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a> dialog. After shares are calculated
              each actor will send a message to the chat telling how many
              experience points they get after applying their share and their
              experience bonus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't forget to set the experience share to 50% for retainers!
